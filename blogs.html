            <h2 class="text-light fw-bolder pt-4">Best PC Build In 2022</h2>
            <p class="blog__text text-light pt-3">1. <span class="text-warning lead">Elite $2,000 4K Gaming PC Build -
                </span>

                $2,000 Gaming PC BuildSo you've decided to go all out… You're not spending a dime under $2,000 on
                computer parts for your new ridiculously awesome computer build. Alright… that's cool… some people just
                have to have the best!

                Fortunately, with a $2,000+ budget you can really max out your build. You can get an extreme video card.
                You can utilize a processor with a ton of cores and threads (which will really help you with stuff like
                video rendering and image editing.) And, you can leave yourself with a lot of options for upgrading in
                the future. (RGB lights, more storage, dual video cards, etc.)

                This is an extreme 4K gaming computer that can easily handle virtual reality and can serve as a powerful
                workstation as well. Also, if you're going to drop this much on a computer, be sure to pair it with some
                high-end peripherals as well, like a quality gaming chair, a G-Sync monitor, and a high-quality gaming
                headset.

                This build features an Intel Core i5-13600KF processor, an RTX 4070 Ti graphics card, and 16GB of DDR5
                RAM. The combination of the RTX 4070 Ti and the i5-13600KF CPU will be more than powerful enough to have
                you maxing out games on a 4K monitor or a 1440P 240Hz monitor.</p><br>

            <p class="blog__text text-light">
                2. <span class="text-warning lead">$1,750 RX 6800 XT Gaming Computer - </span>

                $1,750 Gaming PC BuildFor a price of $1,750, the sky is the limit in terms of performance. Seriously,
                with an RTX 3070 Ti GPU this build is ready to push games on a 4K monitor…

                $1,750 will also give you plenty of other options as well. For instance, if you’re planning on doing
                some system tuning, this kind of budget will allow you to hit some decent overclocks. And, it’s
                definitely a VR-ready PC build (Oculus Rift or HTC Vive).

                Along with the RX 6800 XT graphics card, this build features an Intel Core i5-13600KF, a high-end 360mm
                AIO CPU cooler, and a 850W Gold power supply. You will also get a 1TB NVME SSD and 16GB of 5600MHz DDR5
                RAM.

                While 16GB of memory won’t be used in most titles, newer games are starting to utilize over 8GB of RAM
                and so the extra memory will ensure that you have enough to meet their demands. And, if you’re into RGB
                lighting, the case and CPU cooler in this system come with RGB lights.

                This system is powerful enough to handle any game on max settings on a 1080P or 1440P monitor and it
                will perform well with a 4K monitor as well. For 1080P and 1440P gaming, though, be sure to pair it with
                a higher refresh rate display to fully maximize its performance (like a 1080P 360Hz display or a 1440P
                240Hz display.)</p><br>

            <p class="blog__text text-light">
                3. <span class="text-warning lead">$1,500 High-End Gaming PC -
                </span>
                $1,500 Prebuilt Gaming PCFor $1,500 you’re getting a very similar computer to our $1,250 build. The only
                difference? You get a better CPU/motherboard combination

                While the Intel Core i5-13600K in this system won’t give you a significant in-game performance increase
                over the i5-12400F found in the $1,250 build below, it is a better overall processor that should give
                you a small bump in FPS while gaming and will serve you better for non-gaming tasks as well—and, you can
                overclock it to squeeze even more performance out of it.

                This system also features an RTX 3070 video card, 16GB of DDR5 5600MHz memory, a standard ATX
                motherboard with plenty of RGB lighting features, a 1TB SATA SSD, and a 750W 80 PLUS Gold power supply.

                Ultimately, this build is capable of maxing out anything on a 2560×1440 monitor, handling pretty much
                anything on a 4K monitor, will work well with a 1440P 144Hz+ monitor, and will allow you to get into VR
                with the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. It has plenty of storage for your needs and it has enough space to
                allow you to upgrade in the future as well.

                4. <span class="text-warning lead">4K/VR Monster $1,250 Gaming PC - </span>

                Best $1,250 Gaming PCWith a budget of $1,250 or more, you can expect to get a high-quality custom
                computer. At this price range, you will be able to put together a machine that will be able to handle
                games on 1080P 144Hz monitors, or 240Hz monitors. It will also serve as a 1440P 144Hz or 4K gaming PC as
                well.

                However, playing on the highest settings is just one of the many benefits you will receive when you drop
                $1,250 on parts for a gaming computer. You can also expect your computer to stay relevant for a long
                time and you can be sure that you have high-quality parts all throughout your build. That means along
                with a great processor and excellent video card, you will also get a high-end motherboard and a
                well-built power supply. And, this system easily meets the Oculus Rift requirements so it is definitely
                a VR-ready PC.

                For specs, this build features an Intel Core i5-12600KF procesoor, an RX 6700 XT graphics card, an
                RGB-friendly motherboard, 16GB of memory, a 1TB SATA SSD, and a quality 650W power supply. While this
                system doesn’t have the newer generation Intel CPU or DDR5 memory, the combination of the i5-12600K CPU,
                the 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and the AMD RX 6700 XT GPU will still give you a ton of performance.
            </p><br>

            <p class="blog__text text-light">
                5. <span class="text-warning lead">Balanced $1,000 Intel Gaming PC - </span>

                $1,000 Prebuilt Gaming PCFor a price of $1,000 you can expect to put together a system that can max out
                any game on 2560×1440 resolution and is ready for VR gaming and the Oculus Rift headset. And, you can
                even expect a $1,000 gaming PC to handle playing at 4K just fine.

                The $1,000 mark is the sweet spot for putting together your own computer, as $1,000 in parts is enough
                to provide optimal in-game performance while still maintaining a reasonable budget. This system comes
                with an Intel Core i5-12400F CPU, an AMD RX 6700 XT GPU, 16GB of DDR4 3200MHz RAM, and a 1TB SATA SSD.

                Overall, this is the perfect gaming PC for anyone who is looking to max out titles on a 1080P 144Hz
                monitor, or even a higher 1440P resolution monitor, too. Again, this system should be able to handle
                titles at 4K resolution as well. However, for more demanding games, at 4K resolution, you’ll have to
                turn down some settings in order to maintain a higher framerate. Just make sure you pair this build with
                a monitor that utilizes AMD’s FreeSync technology to provide the smoothest in-game experience possible.

            <h2 class="text-light fw-bolder pt-4">The Best Ways To Clean Your PC</h2>
            <p class="blog__text text-light pt-3">The most important thing to consider when cleaning your case is that
                we want to make it possible for cool, fresh air to get into the case and hot air to get out. If dust
                filters are clogged or there's excess dust collected around the heat sinks, that's not going to be
                possible and your system could overheat.

                To counter that, you want to do everything you can to eliminate dust and leave your system fresh and
                clean.</p>

            <h3 class="text-light">Before you start</h3>
            <ul>
                <ol class="text-light">
                    - Wear a dust mask or respirator if you want to avoid breathing in any of the dust and dirt you
                    remove from your case.
                </ol>
                <ol class="text-light">
                    - Turn off your PC and unplug the power cable from the rear. If you want to be extra safe, unplug
                    everything.
                </ol>
                <ol class="text-light">
                    - Move your computer to somewhere well ventilated if possible, or at least open a window or door to
                    let fresh air into the room.
                </ol>
                <ol class="text-light">
                    - Remove the side panels and (if possible) the front panel of your case.
                </ol>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="text-light">Tools to help</h3>
            <ul>
                <ol class="text-light">
                    - Microfibre cloth - You might want to rub something in there.
                </ol>
                <ol class="text-light">
                    - Compressed air - let's face it, if you want to clean anything on a PC one of these is always good
                    to have on hand.
                </ol>
                <ol class="text-light">
                    - A mini vacuum/blower - If you're sick of buying compressed air you can get one of these pretty
                    cheap. They're not as direct or as powerful but they'll do the job and you can just recharge it
                    instead of needing a new can.
                </ol>
                <ol class="text-light">
                    - Antistatic wristband - You can use your case to ground you, but one of these is never a bad idea.
                </ol>
                <ol class="text-light">
                    - Actual tools - depending on your case and parts, you might need screw drivers or special bits to
                    get things open.
                </ol>
